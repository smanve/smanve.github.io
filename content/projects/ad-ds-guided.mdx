title: "Setting Up Active Directory for Beginners"
summary: "I recently did a short 2-hour guided lab where I set up Active Directory Domain Services on a Windows Server. Instead of going deep into theory, I'll focused on what I actually had to do and the little problems that popped up along the way."

## What I built

* A Windows Server promoted to a **Domain Controller** for `corp.local` (think: the “boss” of the network)
* A basic **OU (Organizational Unit) structure** to keep things tidy (`Corp Users`, `Workstations`)
* A couple of **users and groups**, with a role-based pattern (e.g. Helpdesk group)
* **Password policies** – one for everyone, and a stricter one for admins
* Some **baseline Group Policies** to lock things down

## Core steps (in plain English)

1. **Made the server a Domain Controller** – so it could run AD DS.
2. **Created OUs** – folders where you keep users/computers for easier management.
3. **Added users & groups** – e.g. created Emily Chen, then put her into the Helpdesk group.
4. **Set password rules** – 12+ characters for normal users, 16+ for admins.
5. **Applied baseline security policies** – through Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

## The real lessons (things that went wrong)

* **DNS & time are everything.** If your Domain Controller isn’t using itself as DNS or the time drifts, **Kerberos breaks** and logins fail.

  * Fix: point DNS to `127.0.0.1` and make the DC a reliable time source.

* **Think about OUs first.** Don’t dump policies at the domain root. Put computers/users into OUs and link GPOs there.

* **Password rules aren’t always obvious.** The “Default Domain Policy” applies to everyone, but fine-grained policies only kick in for the groups you explicitly target.

* **Don’t assume policies applied.** Always check with tools like `gpresult /r` or `whoami /all` to confirm.

* **Automate early.** PowerShell makes life easier when adding multiple users/groups – way faster than clicking.

* **Use groups properly.** Instead of giving people permissions directly, add them to groups and assign access at the group level. Cleaner, safer, easier to audit.

## Quick checks I ran

* `Get-ADDomain; Get-ADForest` – make sure the domain is alive.
* `gpresult /r` – confirm which policies apply to a workstation.
* `whoami /all` – see what groups/privileges a logged-in user has.

---

## What I learned

* A reliable AD setup starts with **good DNS, correct time, and a sensible OU design**.
* **Group Policies are powerful** but can also cause chaos – test them in a lab first.
* Fine-grained password policies are best used for special cases (like admins), not everyone.
* **Scripts > clicking around.** Automation makes your setup reproducible.

## What’s next

* Add a second Domain Controller for backup.
* Set up **System State backups**.
* Write and test a **restore runbook** (so I know how to recover if things break).
